abstract = {We derive a nested risk measure for a maximization problem and implement it in a scenario-based formulation of a multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem. We apply the risk-averse formulation to the surveillance and control of a non-native forest insect, the emerald ash borer (EAB), a wood-boring beetle native to Asia and recently discovered in North America. Spreading across the eastern United States and Canada, EAB has killed millions of ash trees and cost homeowners and local governments billions of dollars. We present a mean-Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), multi-stage, stochastic mixed-integer programming model to optimize a manager’s decisions about surveillance and control of EAB. The objective is to maximize the benefits of healthy ash trees in forests and urban environments under a fixed budget. Combining the risk-neutral objective with a risk measure allows for a trade-off between the weighted expected benefits from ash trees and the expected risks associated with experiencing extremely damaging scenarios. We define scenario dominance cuts (sdc) for the maximization problem and under the decision-dependent uncertainty. We then solve the model using the sdc cutting plane algorithm for varying risk parameters. Computational results demonstrate that scenario dominance cuts significantly improve the solution performance relative to that of CPLEX. Our CVaR risk-averse approach also raises the objective value of the least-benefit scenarios compared to the risk-neutral model. Results show a shift in the optimal strategy from applying less expensive insecticide treatment to more costly tree removal as the manager becomes more risk-averse. We also find that risk-averse managers survey more often to reduce the risk of experiencing adverse outcomes.},

abstract = {Abstract Emerald ash borer (EAB), a wood-boring insect native to Asia, was discovered near Detroit in 2002 and has spread and killed millions of ash trees throughout the eastern United States and Canada. EAB causes severe damage in urban areas where it kills high-value ash trees that shade streets, homes, and parks and costs homeowners and local governments millions of dollars for treatment, removal, and replacement of infested trees. We present a multistage, stochastic, mixed-integer programming model to help decision-makers maximize the public benefits of preserving healthy ash trees in an urban environment. The model allocates resources to surveillance of the ash population and subsequent treatment and removal of infested trees over time. We explore the multistage dynamics of an EAB outbreak with a dispersal mechanism and apply the optimization model to explore surveillance, treatment, and removal options to manage an EAB outbreak in Winnipeg, a city of Manitoba, Canada. Recommendation to Resource Managers Our approach demonstrates that timely detection and early response are critical factors for maximizing the number of healthy trees in urban areas affected by the pest outbreak. Treatment of the infested trees is most effective when done at the earliest stage of infestation. Treating asymptomatic trees at the earliest stages of infestation provides higher net benefits than tree removal or no-treatment options. Our analysis suggests the use of branch sampling as a more accurate method than the use of sticky traps to detect the infested asymptomatic trees, which enables treating and removing more infested trees at the early stages of infestation. Our results also emphasize the importance of allocating a sufficient budget for tree removal to manage emerald ash borer infestations in urban environments. Tree removal becomes a less useful option in small-budget solutions where the optimal policy is to spend most of the budget on treatments.},

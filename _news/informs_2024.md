[INFORMS 2024](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/seattle2024/) will be held on **October 20-23, 2024 in Seattle, WA**. I will chair an Invited Session for [ENRE](https://connect.informs.org/energy-natural-resources-and-the-environment/home) titled _Optimization Approaches to Enhancing Biodiversity_. The session will take place in **Regency** building room **701** on **October 20, 12:45 PM - 2:00 PM**. 
In this session I will present a new project I have been working on _An Adaptive Simulation-Optimization Framework to Survey and Control Invasive Species_.

> <p style="text-align: center;"> Abstract</p>
>Invasive species are a serious threat to ecosystems worldwide, calling for innovative methods to survey and control them effectively. This research presents a new approach—an adaptive simulation-optimization framework—specifically designed to tackle the complexities of managing invasive species. This framework is highly adaptable, providing standardized features for different species and offering various simulation options to match different environments and species dynamics. Researchers and practitioners can use this framework to tailor simulations for accurate surveys and strategic control efforts. By incorporating advanced solvers and allowing for problem-specific adjustments, it ensures reliable optimization customized to the specific challenges of invasive species scenarios.
